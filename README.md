Create a super depth map that S-coordinates can use with Hadit(Mirror) axis

So how does this work? The most simple way to explain it is that The Mirror 'moves through' the image.

This image is set so that "Hadit" is more spherical, creating radial spread that scales through the images virtual depth.. but at an angle of 1, it hits everything in the image with the focus being distributed along the edge of the bottom.
